# PHP Pracice Projects

## Project Overview
The repository includes short practice projects. In these projects, I have focused on handling GET and POST requests, and the data which is passed through these methods.

## Techniques and Concepts used within the Projects
- **Data Bouncing**: Implemented using URL parameters to sustain state (GET Requests)
- **Data Validation**: of the UI Elements to prevent exceptions and any unexpected break downs of the application
- **Data Sanitization**: to prevent injection attacks
- **Sticky Web Forms**: through both GET and POST methods
